Exploring Fish Community Responses to Top-down Forcing Using a Multispecies Size Spectrum Model## 📖 Overview

This repository contains the **Mizer model**, a multispecies size-spectrum modeling framework developed to explore the effects of top-down forcing on Marine ecocystem using the Eastern Scotian shelf as a case study
It was developed as part of my PhD research (Dalhousie University & University of Tasmania) and contributes to the **FishMIP intercomparison project**.

The model simulates biomass, catch and mean body weight trajectories for multiple species under fishing and an addition of an hypothesize predation mortality.
